- 👋 Hi, I’m @Steezzee
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things. I would like to learn to program in Swift so I can conceptualize and create software that will bring value to companies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code with Swift. I'm a 3rd year computer engineering student from Dallas, TX.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can.
- 📫 You can reach me at travismstanger@gmail.com.

Some hobbies of mine include: Playing musical instruments (piano, drums.0, guitar), playing video games (currently Apex Legends), playing chess (not very good),
spending time with my daughter (Sophia), going to concerts (311), learning new skills.
