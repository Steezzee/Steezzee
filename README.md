- 👋 Hi, I’m @Steezzee
- 👀 I’m interested in app development and web design. I am learning to program in Swift, Java, React, HTML, CSS, and Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a few projects -- some personal and one professional. I'm a 3rd year computer engineering student at the University of Texas at Dallas.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can. I come from a Sales Management background and would like to use my previous experience in the technology field. 
- 📫 You can reach me at travismstanger@gmail.com.

Some hobbies of mine include: Playing musical instruments (piano, drums, guitar), reading half way through books, playing chess,
spending time with my daughter, going to concerts, and going out on the boat.
